### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
#### ðŸŒ± My name is Viviane Wei Busch-Wallace and Iâ€™m currently learning web development at the Digital Career Institute to become a fullstack web developer.
I love to learn new things and find out how stuff works. Although I don't come from an IT background, I am having lots of fun studying web development right now.
After having spent some years in China, I now live together with my husband and dog in Hamburg, Germany.

What I am learning to use:
