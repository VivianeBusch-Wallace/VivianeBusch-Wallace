### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹
 
#### My name is Viviane Wei Busch-Wallace and Iâ€™m currently learning web development at the Digital Career Institute to become a fullstack web developer. ðŸŒ±
I have become very passionate about programming and love to learn how stuff works. Although I don't come from an IT background, I am having lots of fun studying web development right now. It's just outright awesome! I am eager to learn more and hope that I can create more amazing things for people to share with the world.

#### Tools
